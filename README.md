# Wirebot for UNIX

## Introduction

Wirebot is a chat robot for the Wired 2.0 protocol. It connects to a Wired server and interacts with other users following rules and command setup by the administrator. Wirebot is a kind of mix between Wire and Wired, mainly because it is a client program running as a daemon.

## Features

* Support for Wired 2.0 protocol
* XML-based triggers dictionary
* Custom chat commands
* Many more...

## How it works

Wirebot is basically a client, that receives/sends/replies messages from/to the server. With Wirebot you can define rules that trigger on received messages to execute a corresponding operation, like for example sending a message back. This I/O system is combined to features like multiple-random-outputs, delays or repeats to create an interactive engine for a chat robot. 

The bot also respond to chat commands, thus users can directly execute some operations on-demand. See "Commands " below in the Customize section.

## Install Wirebot (UNIX-like systems)

This tutorial explains how to install and run Wirebot on an UNIX-like operating system.

### Requirements

* Git
* libxml2
* GNU readline
* GNU libiconv
* OpenSSL

Be sure to have these components installed on your system, they are dependencies of libwired and Wirebot. 

### Install form binary

1. Clone Wiredbot repository:

		wget http://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/wired2/wirebot/wirebot.tar.gz
	
2. Move into the clone directory:

		cd wirebot/
	
3. Add git submodules (here, libwired):

		git submodule init && git submodule update
	
4. Configure the package:

		./configure --enable-pthreads

	*The "--enable-pthreads" is currently needed.*
	
5. Compile both libwired and Wirebot

		make
		
	*Use "gmake" on non-GNU systems*
	
6. Install Wirebot:

		sudo make install
		
### Using Wirebot
		
#### Run Wirebot
		
1. Run it a first time:

		wirebot -D -d
	
	*"-D" is to not daemonize the process*
	
	*"-d" is to enable debug mode*
		
	This will launch Wirebot a firt time and it will try to connect to localhost:4875 with "admin" login and no password. Wirebot also created default config files (~/.wirebot/).  Now kill it (^C), and edit the Wirebot config:
	
		nano ~/.wirebot/wirebot.conf
		
	Edit the configuration file for your needs, mainly "hostname", "port", "login" and "password" field. 
	
2. Try to connect again:

		wirebot -D -d
		
	If everything is OK, you should see the following output in the shell:
		
		****% wirebot -D -d
		Info: Reading /home/****/.wirebot/wirebot.conf
		Debug:   nick = WireBot
		Debug:   status = Jedi in the Matrix
		Debug:   auto reconnect = yes
		Debug:   reconnect on kick = no
		Debug:   icon path = icon.png
		Debug:   hostname = localhost
		Debug:   port = 4871
		Debug:   login = admin
		Debug:   password = ********
		Info: Reading /home/****/.wirebot/wirebot.xml robot 
		Info: Writting PID file: /home/****/.wirebot/
		Info: Connecting to localhost...
		Info: Trying ::1 at port 4871...
		Info: Connected using AES/256 bits, logging in...
		Info: Logged in, welcome to Wired Server

#### Run Wirebot, as a daemon

1. Kill it again (^C) and now try to launch it as e daemon:

		/usr/local/bin/wirebot
		
2. To stop it, use the following command:

		kill `cat ~/.wirebot/wirebot.pid`
	
### Customize Wirebot

#### Change the icon

You can update the icon without having to restart the process. Add an "icon.png" file in `~/.wirebot/` directory, and type the following command in the public chat (or private message) where your bot is connected:

	!reload
		
#### Manage Wirebot dictionary

Wirebot chat-bot engine is based on a XML dictionary located at `~/.wirebot/wirebot.xml` by default. In this file, you can found every rules and triggers the bot know. The engine is based on input/output routing of Wired protocol messages, and currenty support two kind your meta-event named `rules` and `commands`.

If you modified the dictionary, you have to send a `!reload` to the bot for changes taking effect.

##### Rules

The shorter way is to take an example:

 	<rules>
		<rule permissions="admin,guest" activated="true">
		 	<input message="wired.chat.say" comparison="contains" sensitive="false">hello</input>
		
		 	<output message="wired.chat.say" delay="1">Hey @INPUT_NICK. :-)</output>
		 	<output message="wired.chat.say" delay="1">Hello @INPUT_NICK. :-)</output>
		 	<output message="wired.chat.say" repeat="3">:-)</output>
		 </rule>
	</rules>

**Definition:**	

* permissions: User logins able to trigger this rule, use "any" for all users.
* activated: Use "true" if the rule is activated, "false" if not.
* inputs:
	* message: The input message name referring to the Wired specifications. 
	See "currently supported messages" below.
	* comparison: The method used to match the input string.
	* sensitive: Use "true" for sensitive matching, "false" otherwise.
* outputs:
	* message: The output message name referring to the Wired specifications.
	* delay: Set a delay before executing the output.
	* repeat: Repeat output action as many time as specified.
	
##### List of currently supported input messages 
	
* wired.chat.say
* wired.chat.me
* wired.message.message
* wired.message.broadcast
* wired.chat.user_join
* wired.chat.user_leave

##### List of currently supported output messages 
	
* wired.chat.say
* wired.chat.me
* wired.message.message
* wired.message.broadcast


##### Commands

TBD

### Mac Users

If you are a Mac user, have a look to [WireBot for Mac](http://wired.read-write.fr/products/wire-bot/). It provides a binary version for OSX and a graphical user interface to edit dictionnary file.
